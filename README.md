# Turbo Meta Utilities

A TypeScript utility library for working with Turborepo monorepos. Provides tools to read, parse, and interact with packages, apps, and package.json metadata in your Turbo-powered monorepo.

## Features

-  Full TypeScript support with type definitions
-  Read and parse package.json files with validation
-  Access packages and apps in your monorepo
-  Resolve package exports and imports
-  100% test coverage
-   Dependency injection support for testing

## Installation

```bash
npm install turbo-meta-utilities
```

## Rationale
Turborepo promotes strong isolation between apps and packages. Each workspace is expected to operate within its own directory boundary, with dependencies declared explicitly through package.json. While this pattern is great for build integrity and cache efficiency, it can become restrictive in practical, developer-facing workflows that rely on cross-package awareness.

Real-world projects often require shared type definitions, file watching, and auto-import behavior across multiple apps. These use cases are side-effect-free (they don’t mutate or build other packages) but they do require the toolchain to know where other packages live within the monorepo. Using relative paths breaks isolation and is volatile due to package names being tied only to their package.json.

For example:
- Typing: Nuxt or Vite often needs to reference .d.ts files from a shared UI or types package to enable autocomplete and linting.
- File watching: During local development, hot module reload (HMR) may depend on detecting file changes in sibling packages.
- Auto-imports: When using features like Nuxt’s autoImports or Volar’s component auto-discovery, the tooling must scan across package directories.

However, because Turborepo discourages relative imports that jump outside a package’s boundary (e.g., ../../packages/ui), developers often face friction between correctness and convenience.

### Why Relative Paths Are Volatile
NPM and Yarn workspaces identify dependencies by package name, not by directory path. This means the following two configurations are equivalent in terms of resolution:

```
apps/web
packages/ui
```

```
apps/my-frontend
packages/awesome-components
```

As long as "name": "@repo/ui" and "dependencies": { "@repo/ui": "*" } are consistent, the actual file layout is irrelevant. Relying on relative paths therefore introduces fragility: any directory restructuring or renaming breaks imports and tooling references.

This makes direct relative linking (../../packages/ui) a poor long-term choice for things like IDE imports, runtime resolution, or local development.

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { Turbo } from 'turbo-meta-utilities';

// Initialize with your monorepo root
const turbo = new Turbo('/path/to/monorepo');

// Get all packages
const packages = turbo.packages;
console.log(packages.map((p) => p.name));

// Get all apps
const apps = turbo.apps;
console.log(apps.map((a) => a.name));

// Find a specific package
const myPackage = turbo.getPackageByName('my-package');
if (myPackage) {
	console.log(myPackage.json.version);
}

// Resolve import paths
const exportTarget = myPackage?.resolveImport('.');
console.log(exportTarget?.default); // Absolute path to default export
```

## API Documentation

### Turbo

Main class for interacting with a Turborepo monorepo.

#### Constructor

```typescript
new Turbo(monorepoRoot: string, fileSystem?: IFileSystemAdapter)
```

- `monorepoRoot`: Absolute path to the monorepo root (must contain `turbo.json`)
- `fileSystem`: Optional file system adapter for testing (defaults to Node.js fs)

**Throws:**

- Error if monorepo root doesn't exist
- Error if path is not a directory
- Error if `turbo.json` not found

#### Properties

- `packagesPath: string` - Path to the packages directory
- `appsPath: string` - Path to the apps directory
- `packages: TurboPackage[]` - Array of all packages
- `apps: TurboApp[]` - Array of all apps
- `allWorkspaces: (TurboPackage | TurboApp)[]` - Combined packages and apps

#### Methods

**`getPackageByName(packageName: string): TurboPackage | undefined`**

Find a package by its name field in package.json.

**`getAppByName(appName: string): TurboApp | undefined`**

Find an app by its name field in package.json.

**`getWorkspaceByName(name: string): TurboPackage | TurboApp | undefined`**

Find any workspace (package or app) by name.

### TurboPackage / TurboApp

Represents a package or app in the monorepo. Both classes extend `BasePackage` and have identical APIs.

#### Constructor

```typescript
new TurboPackage(path: string, fileSystem?: IFileSystemAdapter)
new TurboApp(path: string, fileSystem?: IFileSystemAdapter)
```

- `path`: Absolute path to the package/app directory
- `fileSystem`: Optional file system adapter

**Throws:**

- Error if path doesn't exist
- Error if path is not a directory
- Error if `package.json` not found

#### Properties

- `name: string` - Package name from package.json
- `path: string` - Absolute path to the package
- `json: PackageJson` - Parsed package.json data

#### Methods

**`resolveImport(importPath: string): ExportTarget | undefined`**

Resolves an import path using the package's exports field. Returns absolute paths.

```typescript
const target = package.resolveImport('.');
console.log(target?.default); // /absolute/path/to/dist/index.js
console.log(target?.types); // /absolute/path/to/dist/index.d.ts
```

**`resolvePath(relativePath: string): string`**

Converts a relative path to an absolute path within the package.

```typescript
const srcPath = package.resolvePath('src/index.ts');
// Returns: /absolute/path/to/package/src/index.ts
```

### PackageJson

Represents a parsed and validated package.json file.

#### Constructor

```typescript
new PackageJson(path: string, fileSystem?: IFileSystemAdapter)
```

**Throws:**

- Error if package.json doesn't exist
- Error if JSON is invalid
- Error if package.json doesn't match schema (missing name, etc.)

#### Properties

All standard package.json fields are exposed as getters:

- `name: string`
- `version?: string`
- `main?: string`
- `module?: string`
- `types?: string`
- `dependencies?: Record<string, string>`
- `devDependencies?: Record<string, string>`
- `peerDependencies?: Record<string, string>`
- `scripts?: Record<string, string>`
- `exports?: Record<string, ExportTargetData>`

#### Methods

**`resolveImport(importPath: string): ExportTarget | undefined`**

Resolves an import path using the exports field (relative paths).

### ExportTarget

Represents a resolved export target from package.json.

#### Properties

- `default: string` - Default export path
- `import?: string` - ESM import path
- `require?: string` - CommonJS require path
- `types?: string` - TypeScript types path

### GlobResolver

Resolves import paths using glob patterns from exports field.

```typescript
const resolver = new GlobResolver({
	'.': './dist/index.js',
	'./*': './dist/*.js',
});

const target = resolver.resolveImport('./utils');
```

## Examples

### Working with Packages

```typescript
import { Turbo } from 'turbo-meta-utilities';

const turbo = new Turbo(process.cwd());

// List all packages with their versions
for (const pkg of turbo.packages) {
	console.log(`${pkg.name}@${pkg.json.version}`);
}

// Get dependencies of a package
const myPkg = turbo.getPackageByName('my-package');
if (myPkg) {
	console.log('Dependencies:', myPkg.json.dependencies);
	console.log('Dev Dependencies:', myPkg.json.devDependencies);
}
```

### Working with Apps

```typescript
import { Turbo } from 'turbo-meta-utilities';

const turbo = new Turbo(process.cwd());

// List all apps
console.log(
	'Apps:',
	turbo.apps.map((a) => a.name)
);

// Get an app's scripts
const webapp = turbo.getAppByName('webapp');
if (webapp) {
	console.log('Available scripts:', Object.keys(webapp.json.scripts || {}));
}
```

### Resolving Exports

```typescript
const pkg = turbo.getPackageByName('ui-components');
if (pkg) {
	// Resolve specific exports
	const mainExport = pkg.resolveImport('.');
	const utilsExport = pkg.resolveImport('./utils');

	console.log('Main:', mainExport?.default);
	console.log('Utils:', utilsExport?.default);
}
```

### Testing with Mock File System

```typescript
import { Turbo } from 'turbo-meta-utilities';
import type { IFileSystemAdapter } from 'turbo-meta-utilities';

const mockFs: IFileSystemAdapter = {
	existsSync: (path) => true,
	isDirectory: (path) => true,
	readFileSync: (path) => JSON.stringify({ name: 'test' }),
	readdirSync: (path) => ['package1', 'package2'],
};

const turbo = new Turbo('/fake/root', mockFs);
// Use turbo in tests...
```

## Architecture

This library follows SOLID principles:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has a focused purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible through inheritance and composition
- **Liskov Substitution**: `TurboPackage` and `TurboApp` are interchangeable
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces
- **Dependency Inversion**: File system operations abstracted through `IFileSystemAdapter`
